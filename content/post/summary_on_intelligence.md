We read a lot of papers. I thought it would be beneficial if I document how I organize the summary. 
Sometimes, I am in a hurry and read a lot of papers before summarizing them. 
This results sometimes in anxiety and even worse what you learned will be easily lost. 
By following standarized procedure for reading papers, I hope I can overcome this.
